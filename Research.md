<span style="color: green;">**Summary**</span>: Through my research endeavors, I aspire to develop sustainable approaches to address [water-related issues](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture) in agricultural settings. My objective is to find a harmonious balance between addressing water-related challenges and enhancing agricultural productivity by employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes field research, process-based modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques.<br>
    <br>
<span style="color: green;">**Current Research Highlights**</span>: Intensive agriculture practices in <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/karst-aquifers">karstic</a> sandy soils have resulted in elevated <a href="https://www.mysuwanneeriver.com/DocumentCenter/View/130/2007-Nitrate-Trend-Report?bidId=">nitrate concentrations</a> in Florida water bodies. Therefore, there is a critical need to find a balance between sustained productivity and improved water quality. In response to this issue, my study proposes <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/crop-rotation-practice-standard#:~:text=Section%20205.205%2C%20the%20crop%20rotation%20practice%20standard%2C%20is,conserve%20nutrients%2C%20and%20protect%20the%20soil%20against%20erosion.">rotational production</a> as a potential <a href="https://www.fdacs.gov/Agriculture-Industry/Water/Agricultural-Best-Management-Practices">best management practice (BMP)</a> to mitigate environmental nitrate load. To achieve this objective, I am employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes <a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/AE581">field research</a>, process-based modeling, and machine learning techniques.
