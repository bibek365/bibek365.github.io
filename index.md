I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the University of Florida. 
I obtained my undergraduate degree in agriculture science from Tribhuvan University, Nepal and masterâ€™s degree in plant sciences from the University of Wyoming. 
Through my research endeavors, I aspires to develop sustainable approaches to address water quality issues in agricultural settings, ultimately striking a balance between improved water quality and agricultural productivity.
