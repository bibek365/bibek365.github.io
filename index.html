    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>Bibek is a **Ph.D. Candidate** in the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://abe.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida.
      He has over eight years of experience in agricultural water and nutrient management, employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes field research, 
      process-based modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques. Bibek obtained his undergraduate degree in agriculture science from [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/),
      Nepal, where he developed a keen interest in agricultural water management. He received his masterâ€™s degree in plant sciences from the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/),
      where he focused on [quantifying crop water use](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1822) through satellite remote sensing. With the aim of 
      disseminating his research findings, Bibek has presented at several international conferences and has authored [four publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k5Fv3cMAAAAJ&hl=en) 
      to date. Through his research endeavors, Bibek aspires to develop sustainable approaches to address water quality issues in agricultural settings,
      ultimately striking a balance between improved water quality and agricultural productivity.</p>
