<!--Bibek is a **Ph.D. Candidate** in the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://abe.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida.
He has over eight years of experience in agricultural water and nutrient management, employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes field research, 
process-based modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques. Bibek obtained his undergraduate degree from [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/),
Nepal, where he developed a keen interest in agricultural water management. He received his master’s degree from the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/),
where he focused on [quantifying crop water use](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1822) through satellite remote sensing. With the aim of 
disseminating his research findings, Bibek has presented at several international conferences and has authored [four publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k5Fv3cMAAAAJ&hl=en) 
to date. Through his research endeavors, Bibek aspires to develop sustainable approaches to address water quality issues in agricultural settings,
ultimately striking a balance between improved water quality and agricultural productivity.-->

    Bibek is a <b><span style="color: green;">Postdoctoral Research Associate</span></b> at <a href="https://agriliferesearch.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M AgriLife Research</a>, where he uses process-based modeling to improve corn water use efficiency and refine cotton production recommendations, including developing crop water production functions. He holds a Ph.D. in Agriculture and Biological Engineering from the <a href="https://abe.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>. His doctoral work centered on assessing nitrogen and water transport within a rotational production system. This research involved extensive field investigations and the use of hydrological and crop growth models, including DSSAT, HYDRUS, and SWAT, to tackle challenges related to nutrient management and water quality in agricultural environments.  In 2018, Bibek completed his master’s degree at the <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/">University of Wyoming</a>, where his thesis focused on quantifying and mapping crop evapotranspiration using satellite remote sensing and process-based models such as METRIC, SEBAL, SEBS, and S-SEBI. Bibek’s interest in agricultural water management began during his undergraduate studies at <a href="https://tu.edu.np/">Tribhuvan University</a> in Nepal. Since then, he has continued to expand his expertise, presenting his research at several international conferences and authoring <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k5Fv3cMAAAAJ&hl=en">four publications</a> to date.
