I am a [Ph.D. candidate](/ling607) in the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://abe.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. 
I obtained my undergraduate degree in agriculture science from [Tribhuvan University](https://www.iaas.edu.np/), Nepal, and my masterâ€™s degree was in plant sciences from the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/plantsciences/index.html). 
Through my research endeavors, I aspire to develop sustainable approaches to address water quality issues in agricultural settings, ultimately striking a balance between improved water quality and agricultural productivity.
