<!--Bibek is a **Ph.D. Candidate** in the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://abe.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida.
He has over eight years of experience in agricultural water and nutrient management, employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes field research, 
process-based modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques. Bibek obtained his undergraduate degree from [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/),
Nepal, where he developed a keen interest in agricultural water management. He received his master’s degree from the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/),
where he focused on [quantifying crop water use](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1822) through satellite remote sensing. With the aim of 
disseminating his research findings, Bibek has presented at several international conferences and has authored [four publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k5Fv3cMAAAAJ&hl=en) 
to date. Through his research endeavors, Bibek aspires to develop sustainable approaches to address water quality issues in agricultural settings,
ultimately striking a balance between improved water quality and agricultural productivity.-->

    Bibek is a <b><span style="color: green;">Postdoctoral Research Associate</span></b> at <a href="https://agriliferesearch.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M AgriLife Research</a>. He received his Ph.D. in Agricultural and Biological Engineering from the <a href="https://abe.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>, an M.S. in plant sciences from the <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/">University of Wyoming</a> and a B.S. in Agriculture from <a href="https://tu.edu.np/">Tribhuvan University</a>, Nepal. His work combines process-based modeling, climate model ensembles, remote sensing, and machine learning. He has used these approaches to study evapotranspiration, water productivity, deficit irrigation, climate suitability, crop water production functions, and soil water and solute transport. His experience spans from semi-arid water limited regions of the Texas High Plains and Southwest Kansas, the humid climate of Florida, and the semi-arid to arid inter mountain terrain of Wyoming. His honors include the ASABE Educational Aids Blue Ribbon Award, UF Emerging Scholar recognition, and 19 other awards and recognitions. He currently serves as Satellite Campus Officer for the Texas A&M Postdoctoral Association and has contributed to workshops on crop modeling and evapotranspiration. He has authored 7 refereed journal articles, 1 extension publication, has 5 manuscripts under review. He has delivered more than 30 conference presentations. He serves as a reviewer for various professional societies including ASA, ASABE, AGU and AAAE.
